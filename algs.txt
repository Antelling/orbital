F = G * ((m1 * m2)/r2)
    where:
        F is the force between the masses
            newtons
        G is the gravitational constant (6.674×10?11 N?·?(m/kg)^2);
        m1 is the first mass;
        m2 is the second mass;
            both kg
        r is the distance between the centers of the masses.
            m

okay so we have three units:
    newtons, for force
        1 newton is needed to accelerate 1kg 1m/s^2
    kg, for object weight
        this is used when creating objects
    m, for distance
        this is used when creating objects, and is continually updated


algorithm:
    scale:
        1px = 250,000,000m
    object representation:
        json object
            position
            current vector
            weight
            color
            fixed?
    universe
        universe is size of the screen
        shapes can not move past edges
        however, vectors will not be affected
    so every step:
        calculate positions of each object
            convert planet distances to vectors
                F = G((m1m2)/r^2)
            average vectors
                move along each vector
                move to end point
                update current planet vector
        draw each object
            size determined by mass
            circles
            placed on canvas
